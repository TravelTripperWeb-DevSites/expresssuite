               <h1>An Exclusive Hotel in TriBeCa</h1>
               <h2><a href="/hotels/affordable/cosmopolitan" onclick="">The Cosmopolitan Hotel in TriBeCa</a></h2>
               <p>If any one area sums up New York City&rsquo;s transition from industrial capital to cultural hotbed, it is TriBeCa. The neighborhood, tucked between the shops of SoHo and the offices of the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, went from a commercial and industrial center to an artists&rsquo; community to one of America&rsquo;s most upscale neighborhoods over the course of the past century.</p>
               <p>The past several decades have seen real estate prices boom across TriBeCa as buildings that once housed industrial warehouses and artists&rsquo; lofts became high-end residences with upscale restaurants and bars at street level. The neighborhood delivers a classic and fashionable vibe, with cobblestone streets, elaborate Art Deco buildings, and a sense of luxury, comfort and refinement in a distinct collection of hotels in TriBeCa.</p>
               <p>The <strong><a href="/hotels/affordable/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan Hotel</a></strong><a href="http://triumphhotels.dev.hebsdigital.com/hotels/affordable/cosmopolitan"><strong>&nbsp;in TriBeCa</strong></a>&nbsp;embodies TriBeCa chic at its best. Quiet accommodations provide a welcome respite from the surrounding bustle, with common spaces appointed with modern features and amenities, and an exterior that blends seamlessly with the neighborhood&rsquo;s unique history and identity. Enjoy one of the best hotels in the TriBeCa area.</p>
