               <h1>A Distinct Upper West Side Hotel</h1>
               <h2><a href="/hotels/affordable/belleclaire" onclick="">Hotel Belleclaire</a></h2>
               <p>Landmark brownstones and regal apartment buildings line tree-dotted streets, intersected by the shopping-filled thoroughfare of Broadway. Sidewalk caf&eacute;s, bars and classic New York dining institutions &ndash; along with the 843-acre expanse of Central Park &ndash; lend the area surrounding our Upper West Side hotel a tranquil, community-centered atmosphere that lies in contrast to the busy bustle of Midtown, just a few blocks south.</p>
               <p>The Upper West Side&rsquo;s character and aura of refinement has roots in its authentic pre-war architecture, much of which remains intact. The neighborhood &ndash; once a working-class hamlet in the heart of Manhattan &ndash; is now one of the city&rsquo;s toniest areas, complete with upscale restaurants and many major retailers.</p>
               <p><a href="/hotels/affordable/belleclaire"><strong>Hotel Belleclaire</strong></a> mirrors the character of its Upper West Side neighborhood. Housed in a landmark 1903 Emery Ross building, Belleclaire offers contemporary amenities and a historic feel unmatched by other Upper West Side hotels. From the beautiful bay windows to the details etched in every cornice, Belleclaire is everything an Upper West Side hotel should be: timeless.</p>
