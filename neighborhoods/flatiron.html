               <h2><a href="/hotels/luxury/chandler" onclick="">Hotel Chandler</a></h2>
               <p>Like its namesake building, the Flatiron District is a model of effortless elegance: old New York refinement in unmistakably modern surroundings. The neighborhood surrounding Flatiron District hotels is home to several of the city's best shopping strips, relaxing green spaces, and marquee architecture.</p>
               <p>In many ways, the Flatiron District is a microcosm of the city as a whole. Loft-style apartments abut upscale retailers, adjacent to dimly lit cocktail bars and bustling restaurants. The area&rsquo;s architecture is a pleasant mixture of old and new, with the slim new One Madison Park development standing tall above the trees of Madison Square Park, just behind the Met Life Tower and the Flatiron Building, two gems of early 1900s architecture.</p>
               <p><a href="/hotels/luxury/chandler" onclick="">Hotel Chandler</a>&nbsp;carries the diverse and charismatic spirit of the Flatiron District. Within its stately architecture and refined Beaux-Arts design details, our Flatiron NYC hotel houses decades of history and a commitment to comfort. Juni and the Juni Bar stand out as neighborhood gems, beloved by locals and visitors alike. Our Michelin-starred Flatiron restaurant and bar provides a relaxing escape from the busy city surrounding it.</p>
