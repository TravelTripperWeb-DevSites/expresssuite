                     <p>New York City is known as the dining capital of America, offering a seemingly limitless variety of cuisines. Triumph Hotels embraces the city’s remarkable culinary diversity, operating two upscale restaurants and two signature cocktail bars that set the standard for their respective neighborhoods. <span style="line-height: 1.6;">The NYC dining guide below includes information on upscale destinations in Midtown and Flatiron:</span></p>
                     <p><a href="/restaurants/triomphe/" onclick="">Triomphe Restaurant & Lounge</a> – Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in the heart of the Theater District, Triomphe is known as one of the premier pre-show dining destinations in Midtown. French favorites made with fresh ingredients highlight the Midtown NYC restaurant’s broad menu.</p>
                     <p><a href="/restaurants/lanterns/" onclick="">Lantern’s Keep</a> – Blending downtown creativity with uptown refinement, this cocktail salon stands as one of the premier bars in New York City. Here, expert mixologists craft an array of innovative creations and classic cocktails in an elegant space that hearkens back to the early 20th century.</p>
                     <p><a href="/restaurants/chandler-bar/" onclick="">Hotel Chandler Bar </a>– Locals and visitors alike relax at The Bar at Hotel Chandler, comfortably situated on the border between the Flatiron District and Murray Hill. Carefully curated wine and beer lists – along with specialty and classic cocktails – make this bar a standout.</p>
                     <p><a href="/restaurants/the-rum-house/" onclick="">Rum House </a>– The bar has a distinct downtown sensibility set against a classic New York backdrop. The Rum House is the perfect place for a nightcap, pre-theater drink or an evening of revelry in the heart of Times Square.</p>
