               <h1>Triumph's Historic Hotels In New York</h1>
               <h2>Connect With the Past</h2>
               <p>Our historic New York hotels boast a rich heritage, with the oldest continuously operated hotel in New York, an array of famous residents, and a collection of hotels dating back nearly a century. </p>
               <p>Through the years, the story of Triumph Hotels has been intertwined with iconic and historic figures, including Abraham Lincoln, Joan Rivers, Roy Rogers and many others. <a href="/hotels/affordable/belleclaire/" onclick="">Hotel Belleclaire</a> served as the stomping ground for the elites of New York’s Jazz Age, while <a href="/hotels/luxury/iroquois/" onclick="">The Iroquois New York</a> was the home of James Dean, and <a href="/hotels/affordable/edison/" onclick="">Hotel Edison</a> has been an art deco masterpiece and magnet for famous guests and movie appearances since Thomas Alva Edison himself flipped on the lights at the 1931 Grand Opening. We've always been the top New York hotels for accessible luxury.</p>
               <p>It’s not about nostalgia. It’s about being inspired by the past and using it as a foundation to move forward.</p>
               <p>You can’t fake history – and Triumph doesn’t need to try.<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;"> </span></p>
